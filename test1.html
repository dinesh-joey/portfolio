        <h1>üêæ About Me</h1>
        <p>At 3 months, your German Shepherd is in the exploration and learning stage. Their brain is developing fast, so this is the best time to teach them basic commands like sit, stay, and come. They‚Äôre full of energy, which is normal for this age, and they‚Äôll love running around, playing fetch, or even just chasing you around the house.</p>
        <h2>üçΩÔ∏è Feeding Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pedigree / Puppy food: Gives balanced nutrition.</li>
            <li>Eggs & chicken: Great protein source (boiled or lightly cooked, no spices)</li>
            <li>Curd rice: Safe in small amounts, especially in hot weather ‚Äî helps digestion.
‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid onions, chocolate, grapes, excess salt or oily food.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Care & Training</h2>
        <ul><li>Exercise: Short play sessions (10‚Äì15 min) multiple times a day. Avoid over-exercising since bones are still growing.</li>
        <li>Training: Start with simple commands and reward with small treats.</li>
        <li>Socialization: Let the puppy meet friendly people and other vaccinated dogs to grow confident.</li>
        <li>Health: Regular vet checkups + vaccinations are very important at this age.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>‚ù§Ô∏è Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>German Shepherds grow quickly! By 6 months, your puppy may already look like a small adult but will still act like a mischievous baby. Enjoy these months ‚Äî they are the cutest and most memorable stage.</p>
